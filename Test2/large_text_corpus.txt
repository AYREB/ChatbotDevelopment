multivariate normal diagonal covariance comparing univariate normal created earlier different see univariate normal event shape indicating scalar distribution multivariate normal event shape 2 indicating basic event space distribution two dimensional sampling work multivariate normal general diagonal covariance tfd offer multiple way create multivariate normal including full covariance specification parameterized cholesky factor covariance matrix use first bernoulli distribution represented flip single fair coin also create batch independent bernoulli distribution parameter single distribution object important clear mean call defines three independent bernoulli distribution happen contained python distribution object three distribution manipulated individually note batch shape 3 indicating batch three distribution event shape indicating individual distribution univariate event space call sample get sample three call prob shape semantics log prob use prob small bernoulli example clarity although log prob usually preferred application pas vector evaluate probability coin yielding value api include batch shape semantically one could perform computation creating list distribution iterating loop least eager mode tf graph mode need tf loop however potentially large set identically parameterized distribution extremely common use vectorized computation whenever possible key ingredient able perform fast computation using hardware accelerator previous section created b3 single distribution object represented three coin flip called b3 prob vector v th entry probability th coin take value v suppose instead like specify joint distribution independent random variable underlying family different object mathematically new distribution prob vector v return

although strictly necessary fun fact let create batch three full covariance two dimensional multivariate normal see batch shape 3 three independent multivariate normal event shape 2 multivariate

probability come tail could imagine trying b3 log prob 0 1 unfortunately produce error long readable stack trace b3 3 must pas b3 prob something broadcastable 3 0 1 shape 2 broadcast creates error instead say 0 1 shape 2 1 broadcast shape 3 make broadcast shape 2 3 broadcasting quite powerful case allows order magnitude reduction amount memory used often make user code shorter however
