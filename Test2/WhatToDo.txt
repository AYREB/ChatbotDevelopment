Build the Base Model:

Create a simple conversational model using TensorFlow. This could be a sequence-to-sequence model or a transformer-based model.
Train the model on a general conversational dataset. You can find datasets online or create your own with general conversational examples.
Conversational Base Model:

Once trained, this model will be able to engage in conversations on a variety of topics, but it won't have specialized knowledge.
Gather Text Data on Specific Topic:

Collect text data from websites, articles, or any other sources related to the specific topic you want your chatbot to be knowledgeable about.
Preprocess the Text Data:

Tokenize and preprocess the text data from the specific topic. You may also need to clean the data to remove any noise or irrelevant information.
Fine-Tune the Model:

Fine-tune the base model using the text data from the specific topic. You can use techniques like transfer learning to leverage the knowledge gained from the general conversation dataset.
Evaluate and Test:

Evaluate the performance of your fine-tuned model on specific questions related to the topic. Test its ability to provide accurate and relevant answers.
Iterate and Improve:

Continue to gather more data and fine-tune your model iteratively to improve its performance on the specific topic.
